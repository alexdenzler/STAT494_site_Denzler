<h2>Data Ethics: Data visualization principles</h2>
<p>I had heard of all of the principles from the article because I read <em>Calling Bullshit</em> for a class during Module 3 of this year. The graph that stood out as the worst to me was the one under the section “A changing denominator”. There were many issues with this graph: first, there was too much information on the graph, which made it impossible to decipher. Second, there were a few different scales, which made it extremely difficult to focus on and interpret. Finally, each type of plot on the graph had tons of overlap, making it even more difficult to read. The graph that fooled me was the barplot that did not have zero included on its x-axis. This seems like a common mistake that even an experienced data scientist could make and gloss over. Data visualization is extremely important when discussing the topic of data ethics. Bad data visualizations can mislead the reader, and cause them to spread misinformation.</p>
